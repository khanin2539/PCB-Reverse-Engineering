# PCB-Reverse-Engineering

We are the team of PCB Reverse Engineering with 2 ECE members from Oregon State University. Our goal is to develop a software tool that when supplied with images of a printed circuit board will reverse engineer the netlist for the board. The software will be implemented as a web-based service allowing users to publish the netlist that they generate. This web page will be available to the engineering community for prolonging the life of old equipment as well as documenting systems for repair to reduce waste. Integrating Computer Vision & Deep Learning to the software, this project is aimed to provide precision and reliability without compromises. Currently, we have achieved Object Detection in most PCB images with a stanadaized resolution, and have identified traces on the board. Adding these functionalities as a website will be coming soon.

# What's in this repository

This repository is a hub where codes, image datasets, test results, and other implementration tools are stored as open source and is the place where our clientr and TAs can access to our project. There are several folders that are labeled and links that lead to Google Drive sotring large files as Github limits the maximum upload size.
